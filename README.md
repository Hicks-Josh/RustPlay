# RustPlay
A desktop program for playing Rust scratch files

This program is currently alpha, but has a basic working terminal and compiles and runs rust scratches.  
Currently Windows only.

## Current Features
- Windows support
- Nice titlebar with tabs integrated into decoration
- Multiple tabs
- Can play scratches (very basic functionality currently)
- Nice terminal snapping close / open functionality

## Next Goals
- Theming with config
- Linux Support
- Rename / save / upload to play.rust-lang.org (gist creation functionality is already done)
- Project options window to configure every aspect of the rust scratch build. Will support nearly all optionsthat the website supports!
- Parse color in the terminal
- Possible redesign of terminal window (not sure what to do yet)
- Fix caption buttons to clip ui instead of overlay
- Clearing terminal screen
- Misc bugs such as properly switching terminal to other tabs terminal output when switching tabs
